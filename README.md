This project is a web page that generates random quotes using an external API. It allows users to click a button to fetch a new quote and display it on the page.

## Technologies Used

## Getting Started

To use the Random Quote Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Click the "Get Quote" button to fetch and display a new random quote.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

• index.html: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page and includes the necessary CSS and JavaScript files.
• style.css: The CSS file that contains the styles and layout for the web page.
• script.js: The JavaScript file that handles the fetching of random quotes from an external API and updates the content on the web page.

## Customization

If you want to customize the appearance or behavior of the Random Quote Generator, you can modify the CSS styles in the style.css file. You can also make changes to the JavaScript code in the script.js file to customize the functionality of the quote generator.

## External Resources

• Poppins Font: The Google Fonts stylesheet is included in the HTML file to import the "Poppins" font with two different weights (400 and 600).
• Quotable API: The API endpoint used to fetch random quotes. The JavaScript code in script.js makes a GET request to this API to retrieve a new quote.
